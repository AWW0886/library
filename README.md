TO DO:

- clearForm method: doesn't quite do what it's supposed to..
    - it does clear the input form, but also clears any added cards
    - perhaps related to the storage, which is taught later

- I'd like to have the notes icon show the notes info upon either hovering or clicking
    - currently, any notes icon only triggers the very first card's notes, regardless of which icon is clicked
    - any added notes will not appear due to being set to 'display: none;'

- editBook for whatever reason puts the card data back into the form as "undefined"

- I would like the input form to reappear when at the certain screen width, even if the form was minimized at the smallest screen width
    - currently, when the input form is minimized at the smallest width, it does not reappear when transitioned back to the wider screen width

- see if there's a way to keep the same pointer when hovering over icon as well as when the title appears

- DISABLED:
    - clear button
    - notes textarea

- NOT FUNCTIONING CORRECTLY YET:
    - clear button
    - notes showHide method
    - edit icon/method
